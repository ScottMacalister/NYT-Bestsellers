NYT Bestseller List Data Fetcher

Overview

This project uses the New York Times’ ‘Books API’, supplemented with Wikipedia information, to compare the bestselling works of fiction from 2013 and 2023. The goal is to gain insights into how the demographic makeup of America’s most read authors has changed over the past decade.

The New York Times bestseller list is widely considered the most important list of best-selling books in America. It has been published weekly since October 12, 1931, and has evolved into multiple lists, including Fiction, Nonfiction, Audio, Children’s Books, and Graphic Novels. For this project, I chose to focus on the "Combined Print & E-Book Fiction" list.
